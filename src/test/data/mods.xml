	<abstract xml:lang="en"> This Paper reviews the pros and cons of an
		early EU enlargement towards Central and Eastern European Countries
		(CEECs hereafter). First, the Maastricht criteria, which cannot be
		literally assessed during the catching up process, but that
		nevertheless mirror the huge efforts undertaken in order to (i)
		stabilise the economies, (ii) converge towards the EU, and then (iii)
		participate into the EMU, are analysed. Second, real convergence is
		observed to occur at different rates, depending upon the initial
		conditions faced and the productivity gains realised by each country.
		Third, computing the correlation of demand and supply shocks in a wide
		sample of Euro countries and the CEECs, gives some indication of the
		similarity of the business cycles and economic structures of the CEECs
		on the one hand, and the EU on the other. Yet, we argue that looking
		at static correlation only (averaged over the last decade) is too
		simplistic, as the transition process will blur these averages. Using
		the Kalman filter, we are EU enlargement towards Central and Eastern
		European Countries (CEECs hereafter). First, the Maastricht criteria,

		the Kalman filter, we are able to compute time varying correlation,
		hence differentiating between the transition and the most recent
		period. Our results emphasise an ongoing process of demand shocks
		convergence, but supply shocks divergence. Various exchange rate
		strategies are then discussed. </abstract>

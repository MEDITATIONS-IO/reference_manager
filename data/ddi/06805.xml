      <abstract>This survey focuses on the views and behaviors of the mass
public in China with respect to economic and governmental factors at
the local countryside level in the post-Mao era. The data were
collected approximately eight months after the June 1989 conflict in
Tiananmen Square, Beijing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in
the household by advanced students from Beijing University. Major
topics addressed include perceived seriousness of problems such as
health care, pricing, public order, industrial development, economic
well-being, consumer behavior, personal problems and how to overcome
them, perceived local problems, views about leaders and important
groups, political interest, media behavior, civic competence and
political reform, and perceptions of injustice. Demographic variables
include sex, age, ethnicity, education level, occupation, marital
status, military service, household income, political party
affiliation, age and number of children, and the number of people in
the household.</abstract>

        <sampProc>The sampling went through four stages. Four counties were
selected using nonprobability techniques. Probability procedures were
used for subsequent sampling. Five townships were initially selected
in each county and then three villages within each township. These
units were selected with probability proportionate to size (pps) with
stratification by income level being introduced at the township
stage. In addition, each county seat was selected as a
self-representing area. Within each village, individual respondents
were drawn from household listings, using interval sampling.
Approximately the same number of respondents were targeted in each
village, and roughly equal numbers of respondents were targeted from
each county as well.</sampProc>
        <collMode>face-to-face interview</collMode>
        <weight>The data contain a weight variable (M0011) that should be
used in analyzing the data. The study design called for approximately
equal sized samples within each county, which varied in population
size. The weight variable takes into account the resultant unequal
selection probabilities across the four counties. Each respondent
within a given county has the same weight. Use of this weight variable
is appropriate when making descriptive statements about the sample as
a whole.</weight>

      <notes>(1) The data available for download are not weighted,
and users will need to weight the data prior to analysis. (2) To
protect respondent confidentiality, codes in variables M7002 and M7003
were blanked by the principal investigator, and the names of the
counties, townships, and villages corresponding to codes in variables
M0003, M0004, and M0005 were intentionally omitted. (3) Value labels
for unknown codes were added in several variables. (4) Several values
in variables M2084, M3111, M3121, and M3131 were recoded in order to
conform to the valid values listed in the original documentation. (5)
The CASEID variable was created for use with online analysis.</notes>
